The main program is found in Trees.java  and uses TreeSearch.java and Node.java to build the different tree types.
Currently it is able to:
    - Do insert, search, and delete for a BST.
    - Use inheritance for the AVL tree.
    - Do insert, search, and delete for an AVL tree.
    - Find the time it takes to do each individual task and the total time for BST and an AVL tree.
I was not able to implement the RB tree correctly.  Currently, the insert and delete time shown are from having it
use BST's insert and delete functions.  It is not capable of searching for a book as it returns a null pointer when
allowed to search.

The input files are hard coded in so it is not able to use any file besides the two given ones.  The user chooses which one to use at the begining of the code.
