The main program is found in Finditfast.java and uses List.java to build its linked lists.
It is currently able to find every occurence of the given pattern using a brute force seach and with KMP search.
It is also able to do a time analysis of all three search methods.
Boyer-Moore currently only uses good suffix heuristics and only finds the first occurence of the given pattern.
The input files given by the professor are also hard coded in, i.e. the input files must be in the same file as Finditfast.java.
    -The user is given a chance to select whether they would like to search for the pattern they entered in either prog1input1 or prog1input2.
